    /* This function has 5 parameters, and the declaration in the
       C-language would look like:

       void matadd (int **C, int **A, int **B, int height, int width)

       C, A, B, and height will be passed in r0-r3, respectively, and
       width will be passed on the stack.

       You need to write a function that computes the sum C = A + B.

       A, B, and C are arrays of arrays (matrices), so for all elements,
       C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]

       You should start with two for-loops that iterate over the height and
       width of the matrices, load each element from A and B, compute the
       sum, then store the result to the correct element of C. 

       This function will be called multiple times by the driver, 
       so don't modify matrices A or B in your implementation.

       As usual, your function must obey correct ARM register usage
       and calling conventions. */
